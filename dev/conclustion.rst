Conclusion
##########

We are quite satisfied with the results of the whole project. We were able to implement all the core features from the project specification and then we focused on improving the user experience and adding new features.

We believe that were able to handle the project management aspect of the whole process quite well. We held weekly meetings where we discussed what had been done since the previous meeting and what were our next plans. Because of that, we all knew what other teams members were doing. These meetings were also quite useful when we needed to discuss some problems or new features and how to proceed. We tried to divide our work into smaller tasks which were tracked on a Kanban-like board. As a result, we were able to easily track what needed to be done from each member of our team.

It would be better if we were able to finish the development process earlier and had more time to focus on testing, fixing bugs and writing documentation. There were probably several reasons behind that: 

- Due to school exams and other responsibilities of some of us, we had only 4 months from the beginning of the implementation phase to the deadline of the project.
- Most of the core features of the platform were ready quite early but we kept on improving the user experience and adding new features.
- We could sometimes improve our time management and work harder when it was needed.

Unfortunately, we were not able to test the platform with a larger number of people to simulate a school tournament being held. It is, therefore, expected that we will have to make some improvements when the platform goes live and people start to use tournaments for educational purposes.
