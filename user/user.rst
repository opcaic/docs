Tournament list
==========================

On the tournament list page, users can browse tournaments that were published on the platform. 

Tournament detail
==========================

The tournament detail page contains all the information related to a single tournament. The page is divided into multiple tabs that can be accessed through the inner page menu. Some tabs are only available to logged in users (*My submissions* and *My matches*). If the tournament accepts submissions, the menu also contains a button that lets users submit a solution to the tournament.

Overview
--------------------------

The *Overview* tab provides basic information about the tournament like its state, scope, format, number of players, etc. It also contains a description of the tournament provided by its organizer. Organizers can also decide to divide the description into multiple pages, in which case a navigation appears on the left-hand side of the tab.

Leaderboard
--------------------------

The *Leaderboard* tab displays the overall standings of the players in the tournament. For ongoing tournaments, leaderboards are provided right after the first match is played. Whereas for tournaments with deadline, leaderboards are displayed only after all the matches are played.

Matches
--------------------------

The *Matches* tab displays all the matches that were played in the tournament and provides access to match details with additional information about the matches. 

Tournament organizers can decide to make the match log private which means that no matches are displayed on this tab and players can only see their own matches on the *My matches* tab.
